This was my university final year project, LMS full form is Learning Management system. It's an online environment we can maintain all sorts of eLearning courses, Track completions & result. In this environment A Faculty can track their learner's progress and also have the ability to mark on their performances. The use case of this LMS is also helpful for the HR of any organization where they can coordinate training and tracks employees skills. The UX is very user friendly and easy to use. It also has analytical ability to track down progress of certain groups. Not only that, From this we also can communicate with the inter department as well as PMs.
